# Flask Performance Testing with Locust

This project demonstrates how to perform performance testing on a Flask application using Locust. Locust is an open-source load testing tool that allows you to define user behavior in Python code and simulate large numbers of users to stress test your application.

## Features
- **Locust Integration:** Automates the load testing of your Flask application.
- **Simulates User Load:** Tests how your app performs under different levels of traffic.
- **Customizable Test Scenarios:** Define user behavior and simulate various interactions with your app.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Locust

## Setup Instructions
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-performance-testing-locust.git
   cd flask-performance-testing-locust
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
flask run
Run Locust tests:

bash
Copy code
locust -f locustfile.py
Open your browser and navigate to:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:8089
Use the web interface to configure the number of users and spawn rate, and start the performance test.
Usage
Flask Application: The Flask app is a simple web app that serves as the target for performance testing.
Locust: Locust simulates user activity on the application to test its scalability under load.
